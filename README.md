# Introduction

The subject of testing was a test e-commerce website located at https://www.saucedemo.com/. It is possible to log in with six different accounts, each of which has certain faults and behaviors. 

The objective was to determine if the ordering process functions consistently across all accounts. The goal was achieved through the use of E2E testing methodology.

# Test Environment

Test automation: Robot Framework extended with Selenium library
Browser: Google Chrome  
OS: Xubuntu  
Hardware: Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon  
Processor: Intel Core i7  

# Test Suites

Each available account represented a test suite.

standard_user  
locked_out_user  
problem_user  
performance_glitch_user  
error_user  
visual_user  

Password for all accounts: secret_sauce

# Test Flow

The testing proceeded according to the test plan. Automated test cases were created based on the test cases documented during the planning phase, and the same test cases were implemented in each of the six test suites.

Testing was concluded as the objective was to determine whether the order process of the online store functioned similarly for all users, and this objective was met.

# Test Results

There were a total of 60 test cases, out of which 39 passed, and 21 failed. Next, I'll categorize the errors by test suite.

- standard_user: All tests passed. 10/10.
- locked_out_user: None of the tests passed because the user couldn't log in with the provided credentials. 0/10.
- problem_user: According to the report generated by Robot Framework, the functionality of the site was unstable for this user. The tool failed to recognize some buttons in the same way as with other users, and there were also disruptions in the functionality of the text field when placing an order. 4/10.
- performance_glitch_user: All tests passed, even though the user operated with a slower connection than others. 10/10.
- error_user: Except for entering order information, the same tests failed as with the problem_user. That is, there were issues with button clicks. 5/10.
- visual_user: All tests passed. 10/10.

As noted, errors were concentrated on three users, with one (locked_out_user) accounting for approximately 48% of all errors. The errors for problem_user and error_user were practically in the same locations.

According to Robot Framework statistics, all tests were executed in 1 minute and 1 second.
